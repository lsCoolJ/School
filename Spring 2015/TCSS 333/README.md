# TCSS 333 C for System Programming

This folder contains all of the homework assignments given throughout the spring quarter of 2015 TCSS 333 class. I did not make any of these assignments. With these assignments are my specific answers to each. There are multiple ways to solve each problem and the way I did is not necessarily the best.
